    "Multiple inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages where a class can inherit properties and methods from more than one parent class. In other words, a class can inherit from multiple classes, thus inheriting the attributes and behaviors of all its parent classes.ultilevel inheritance, we have one parent class and child class that is derived or inherited from that parent class. We have a grand-child class that is derived from the child class."

    "Ans:- Method overriding is an ability of any object-oriented programming language that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class."
